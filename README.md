# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning techniques. It aims to classify the sentiment of textual data into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Features
Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
Machine Learning Models: Implements various models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and LSTM Neural Networks for sentiment classification.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate model performance.
Deployment: Provides options for deployment, such as REST API using Flask or integration into a web application.
Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask (for API)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
